# About the data

### Use of Force (UOF)
- The IMPD Use of Force data is found on the OpenIndy's [website](http://data.indy.gov/). 
It shows there have been 63,413 individual incidents of use of force on citizens (their terminology)
from sometime in 2014-2019, July. Before 2014 (July technically, but there is some data from January of that year), 
the data was all entered manually and not digitized into a .csv file. This data is currently being sought after.
The data was extremely messy, and I have been reaching out for clarification on some of the data points. 
*see Outliers for the reasoning behind that needed clarification (coming soon)*

### Uniform Crime Report (UCR)
- The Uniform Crime Report data is also found on the OpenIndy's website. It is the crime statistics reported to 
the FBI. The data can also be found on the FBI's UCR website, although it is consistently years behind. This data
needed no cleaning whatsoever. 


### Citizen Complaints on IMPD Officers
-Brief analysis of data: 1 officer was 'Coached/Mentored', 
    - 1 officer vacated their position, 
    - 1 finding was 'Not Justified',

    - 345 findings were 'Sustained',
    - 1028 findings were 'Not Sustained',
    - 1556 findings were 'Exonerated',
    - and 74 investigation results were 'Unreported'.
