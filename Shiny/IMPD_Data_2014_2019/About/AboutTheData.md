# About the data

### Use of Force (UOF)
- The IMPD Use of Force data is found on the OpenIndy's [website](http://data.indy.gov/). 
It shows there have been 63,413 individual incidents of use of force on citizens
from 2015 to July 2019, with some data from 2014. Before 2014 (July technically, but there is some data from January of that year), 
the data was all entered manually and not digitized into a .csv file. This data is currently being sought after.
The data was extremely messy, and I have been reaching out for clarification on some of the data points. 
*see Outliers for the reasoning behind that needed clarification (coming soon)*

- About the UoF data
There were a total of 6567 citizens that had a use of force applied to them from 2014-2019, at a rate of ~11 individual recorded use of forces applied to each individual. There were  73,083 incidents of use of force by the IMPD on the local population. This number does not mean there were 73,083 individual citizens having use of force physically applied to them, but 73,083 incidents of use of force. Each 'incident' is one single use of force from one officer to one citizen. 60,613 incidents resulted in arrest, 2,794 incidents did not result in an arrest.
